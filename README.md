OPD20 HTML Documentation

An HTML re-write of the One Piece D20 game's manual.

The original documentation can be found at http://www.badkarmagames.com/

I am not the original author of the manual, just refreshing it with much needed improvements.


Uses twitter bootstrap (http://www.getbootstrap.com/) and jquery(http://www.jquery.com/).

This will be turned into a CMS-style documentation (with user authentication to add/edit pages) after I get the core structure built.
